# DreamApp v2 – Manual Flow (No API)

Single-file prototype for your *copy/paste* workflow:
- **One prompt per framework** (Jung, Gestalt, Shamanic, Cognitive/Neuropsych, Freud).
- **Depth passes** (Plain / Standard / Advanced) are generated from the *model output* without touching framework prompts.
- **Freud** defaults to *Plain & Sanitized* for general audiences (age-gate Standard/Advanced later).

## How to use
1. Open the HTML in your browser.
2. Pick a framework and paste your dream.
3. Click **Copy framework prompt** → paste into Incognito ChatGPT/Claude.
4. Paste the **model output** back into the left pane.
5. Click any **Generate Depth** button → copy the depth prompt and run it.
6. Compare **Model Output** vs **Depth Output** side by side.

## Why this file?
- No keys, no servers, no storage. Perfect while you refine UX and prompts.
- Easy to drop into GitHub and deploy on Vercel later (static hosting).

## File naming
- `v2_DreamApp_ManualFlow.html` — this UI.
- `v2_README.md` — this guide.
